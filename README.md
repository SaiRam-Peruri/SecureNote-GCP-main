# 🔐 SecureNote – Encrypted Note Sharing Platform (MERN Stack)

**SecureNote** is a production-ready web application built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) that enables secure, anonymous, and self-destructing note sharing. It provides features like **end-to-end encryption**, **password protection**, **read-tracking**, and **auto-expiring links**, making it ideal for privacy-focused users such as journalists, lawyers, or internal teams sharing sensitive data.

## 🚀 Key Features

* 🔒 **End-to-End Encryption**
  Notes are encrypted on the client side and can only be decrypted with a valid key, ensuring complete confidentiality.

* 🕒 **Self-Destructing Notes**
  Notes are automatically deleted after being read once or when they expire at a specified time.

* 🔗 **One-Time Shareable Links**
  Generate secure, single-use URLs for sharing notes.

* 🛡️ **Password Protection**
  Add an extra layer of security by requiring a password to open a note.

* 📩 **Read Notifications**
  Get instant email alerts when a note is accessed.

## ☁️ Deployment (Planned on Google Cloud Platform)

In the future, SecureNote will be deployed on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** using the following services:

| GCP Service               | Purpose                                                            |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Cloud Run**             | Host the backend Node.js API in a serverless, scalable environment |
| **Firestore / Atlas**     | MongoDB or Firestore for storing notes securely                    |
| **Cloud Storage**         | (Optional) To store file attachments securely                      |
| **Cloud Scheduler**       | Automate note expiration and cleanup jobs                          |
| **Pub/Sub**               | Handle read-event triggers and email queue messaging               |
| **Cloud Functions**       | Lightweight triggers for self-destruct and notifications           |
| **IAM & Secret Manager**  | Secure access control and environment variables                    |
| **Vercel or GCP Hosting** | Frontend deployment with HTTPS and CDN support                     |
